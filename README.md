# AgentApp
Simulation environment for a swarm of agents moving in a velocity Ô¨Åeld

This application is developed to simulate movement of a swarm of agents in a velocity field. Program is developed in C++, and Matlab engine is used to visualize the results. 

To compile and run the program, Matlab's directories' paths should be assigned to Visual Studio project. Version of the Matlab should be 32 bit for compatibility with the 32 bit compiler of Visual Studio.

The experiment area is created according to console input of user, the program makes the calculations in the background.At the end, program reports the positions of agents in the determined time steps and report the positions of determined single agents with graphs of Matlab.
